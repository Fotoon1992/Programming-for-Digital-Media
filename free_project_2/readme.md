[Free Project 11-1] Image Manipulation as You Like It:

Pixelize is a function that is almost in all image editing software. Recently I'm using GIMP, and this type of filter is listed under blur with name pixelize. This filter is changing the image's pixels to be more noticeable. 
The function of this project works the same way; it pixelizes any image and returns it to be viewed by users.
