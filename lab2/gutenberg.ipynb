The Partners attacked,\nstriking with a speed faster than Man's, going from attack to attack\nuntil the Rats or themselves were destroyed. Almost all the time, it\nwas the Partners who won.\n\nWith the safety of the inter-stellar skip, skip, skip of the ships,\ncommerce increased immensely, the population of all the colonies went\nup, and the demand for trained Partners increased.\n\nUnderhill and Woodley were a part of the third generation of\npinlighters and yet, to them, it seemed as though their craft had\nendured forever.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nGearing space into minds by means of the pin-set, adding the Partners\nto those minds, keying up the mind for the tension of a fight on which\nall depended--this was more than human synapses could stand for long.\nUnderhill needed his two months' rest after half an hour of fighting.\nWoodley needed his retirement after ten years of service. They were\nyoung. They were good. But they had limitations.\n\nSo much depended on the choice of Partners, so much on the sheer luck\nof who drew whom.\n\n\n\n\nTHE SHUFFLE\n\n\nFather Moontree and the little girl named West entered the room. They\nwere the other two pinlighters. The human complement of the Fighting\nRoom was now complete.\n\nFather Moontree was a red-faced man of forty-five who had lived the\npeaceful life of a farmer until he reached his fortieth year. Only\nthen, belatedly, did the authorities find he was telepathic and agree\nto let him late in life enter upon the career of pinlighter. He did\nwell at it, but he was fantastically old for this kind of business.\n\nFather Moontree looked at the glum Woodley and the musing Underhill.\n\"How're the youngsters today? Ready for a good fight?\"\n\n\"Father always wants a fight,\" giggled the little girl named West. She\nwas such a little little girl. Her giggle was high and childish. She\nlooked like the last person in the world one would expect to find in\nthe rough, sharp dueling of pinlighting.\n\nUnderhill had been amused one time when he found one of the most\nsluggish of the Partners coming away happy from contact with the mind\nof the girl named West.\n\nUsually the Partners didn't care much about the human minds with which\nthey were paired for the journey. The Partners seemed to take the\nattitude that human minds were complex and fouled up beyond belief,\nanyhow. No Partner ever questioned the superiority of the human mind,\nthough very few of the Partners were much impressed by that\nsuperiority.\n\nThe Partners liked people. They were willing to fight with them. They\nwere even willing to die for them. But when a Partner liked an\nindividual the way, for example, that Captain Wow or the Lady May\nliked Underhill, the liking had nothing to do with intellect. It was a\nmatter of temperament, of feel.\n\nUnderhill knew perfectly well that Captain Wow regarded his,\nUnderhill's, brains as silly. What Captain Wow liked was Underhill's\nfriendly emotional structure, the cheerfulness and glint of wicked\namusement that shot through Underhill's unconscious thought patterns,\nand the gaiety with which Underhill faced danger. The words, the\nhistory books, the ideas, the science--Underhill could sense all that\nin his own mind, reflected back from Captain Wow's mind, as so much\nrubbish.\n\nMiss West looked at Underhill. \"I bet you've put stickum on the\nstones.\"\n\n\"I did not!\"\n\nUnderhill felt his ears grow red with embarrassment. During his\nnovitiate, he had tried to cheat in the lottery because he got\nparticularly fond of a special Partner, a lovely young mother named\nMurr. It was so much easier to operate with Murr and she was so\naffectionate toward him that he forgot pinlighting was hard work and\nthat he was not instructed to have a good time with his Partner. They\nwere both designed and prepared to go into deadly battle together.\n\nOne cheating had been enough. They had found him out and he had been\nlaughed at for years.\n\nFather Moontree picked up the imitation-leather cup and shook the\nstone dice which assigned them their Partners for the trip. By senior\nrights, he took first draw.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe grimaced. He had drawn a greedy old character, a tough old male\nwhose mind was full of slobbering thoughts of food, veritable oceans\nfull of half-spoiled fish. Father Moontree had once said that he\nburped cod liver oil for weeks after drawing that particular glutton,\nso strongly had the telepathic image of fish impressed itself upon his\nmind. Yet the glutton was a glutton for danger as well as for fish. He\nhad killed sixty-three Dragons, more than any other Partner in the\nservice, and was quite literally worth his weight in gold.\n\nThe little girl West came next. She drew Captain Wow. When she saw who\nit was, she smiled.\n\n\"I _like_ him,\" she said. \"He's such fun to fight with. He feels so\nnice and cuddly in my mind.\"\n\n\"Cuddly, hell,\" said Woodley. \"I've been in his mind, too. It's the\nmost leering mind in this ship, bar none.\"\n\n\"Nasty man,\" said the little girl. She said it declaratively, without\nreproach.\n\nUnderhill, looking at her, shivered.\n\nHe didn't see how she could take Captain Wow so calmly. Captain Wow's\nmind _did_ leer. When Captain Wow got excited in the middle of a\nbattle, confused images of Dragons, deadly Rats, luscious beds, the\nsmell of fish, and the shock of space all scrambled together in his\nmind as he and Captain Wow, their consciousnesses linked together\nthrough the pin-set, became a fantastic composite of human being and\nPersian cat.\n\nThat's the trouble with working with cats, thought Underhill. It's a\npity that nothing else anywhere will serve as Partner. Cats were all\nright once you got in touch with them telepathically. They were smart\nenough to meet the needs of the fight, but their motives and desires\nwere certainly different from those of humans.\n\nThey were companionable enough as long as you thought tangible images\nat them, but their minds just closed up and went to sleep when you\nrecited Shakespeare or Colegrove, or if you tried to tell them what\nspace was.\n\nIt was sort of funny realizing that the Partners who were so grim and\nmature out here in space were the same cute little animals that people\nhad used as pets for thousands of years back on Earth. He had\nembarrassed himself more than once while on the ground saluting\nperfectly ordinary non-telepathic cats because he had forgotten for\nthe moment that they were not Partners.\n\nHe picked up the cup and shook out his stone dice.\n\nHe was lucky--he drew the Lady May.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Lady May was the most thoughtful Partner he had ever met. In her,\nthe finely bred pedigree mind of a Persian cat had reached one of its\nhighest peaks of development. She was more complex than any human\nwoman, but the complexity was all one of emotions, memory, hope and\ndiscriminated experience--experience sorted through without benefit of\nwords.\n\nWhen he had first come into contact with her mind, he was astonished at\nits clarity. With her he remembered her kittenhood. He remembered every\nmating experience she had ever had. He saw in a half-recognizable\ngallery all the other pinlighters with whom she had been paired for the\nfight. And he saw himself radiant, cheerful and desirable.\n\nHe even thought he caught the edge of a longing--\n\nA very flattering and yearning thought: _What a pity he is not a cat._\n\nWoodley picked up the last stone. He drew what he deserved--a sullen,\nscared old tomcat with none of the verve of Captain Wow. Woodley's\nPartner was the most animal of all the cats on the ship, a low,\nbrutish type with a dull mind. Even telepathy had not refined his\ncharacter. His ears were half chewed off from the first fights in\nwhich he had engaged.\n\nHe was a serviceable fighter, nothing more.\n\nWoodley grunted.\n\nUnderhill glanced at him oddly. Didn't Woodley ever do anything but\ngrunt?\n\nFather Moontree looked at the other three. \"You might as well get your\nPartners now. I'll let the Scanner know we're ready to go into the\nUp-and-Out.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE DEAL\n\n\nUnderhill spun the combination lock on the Lady May's cage. He woke\nher gently and took her into his arms. She humped her back\nluxuriously, stretched her claws, started to purr, thought better of\nit, and licked him on the wrist instead. He did not have the pin-set\non, so their minds were closed to each other, but in the angle of her\nmustache and in the movement of her ears, he caught some sense of\ngratification she experienced in finding him as her Partner.\n\nHe talked to her in human speech, even though speech meant nothing to\na cat when the pin-set was not on.\n\n\"It's a damn shame, sending a sweet little thing like you whirling\naround in the coldness of nothing to hunt for Rats that are bigger and\ndeadlier than all of us put together. You didn't ask for this kind of\nfight, did you?\"\n\nFor answer, she licked his hand, purred, tickled his cheek with her\nlong fluffy tail, turned around and faced him, golden eyes shining.\n\nFor a moment, they stared at each other, man squatting, cat standing\nerect on her hind legs, front claws digging into his knee. Human eyes\nand cat eyes looked across an immensity which no words could meet, but\nwhich affection spanned in a single glance.\n\n\"Time to get in,\" he said.\n\nShe walked docilely into her spheroid carrier. She climbed in. He saw\nto it that her miniature pin-set rested firmly and comfortably against\nthe base of her brain. He made sure that her claws were padded so that\nshe could not tear herself in the excitement of battle.\n\nSoftly he said to her, \"Ready?\"\n\nFor answer, she preened her back as much as her harness would permit\nand purred softly within the confines of the frame that held her.\n\nHe slapped down the lid and watched the sealant ooze around the seam.\nFor a few hours, she was welded into her projectile until a workman\nwith a short cutting arc would remove her after she had done her duty.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe picked up the entire projectile and slipped it into the ejection\ntube. He closed the door of the tube, spun the lock, seated himself in\nhis chair, and put his own pin-set on.\n\nOnce again he flung the switch.\n\nHe sat in a small room, _small_, _small_, _warm_, _warm_, the bodies\nof the other three people moving close around him, the tangible lights\nin the ceiling bright and heavy against his closed eyelids.\n\nAs the pin-set warmed, the room fell away. The other people ceased to\nbe people and became small glowing heaps of fire, embers, dark red\nfire, with the consciousness of life burning like old red coals in a\ncountry fireplace.\n\nAs the pin-set warmed a little more, he felt Earth just below him,\nfelt the ship slipping away, felt the turning Moon as it swung on the\nfar side of the world, felt the planets and the hot, clear goodness of\nthe Sun which kept the Dragons so far from mankind's native ground.\n\nFinally, he reached complete awareness.\n\nHe was telepathically alive to a range of millions of miles. He felt\nthe dust which he had noticed earlier high above the ecliptic. With a\nthrill of warmth and tenderness, he felt the consciousness of the Lady\nMay pouring over into his own. Her consciousness was as gentle and\nclear and yet sharp to the taste of his mind as if it were scented\noil. It felt relaxing and reassuring. He could sense her welcome of\nhim. It was scarcely a thought, just a raw emotion of greeting.\n\nAt last they were one again.\n\nIn a tiny remote corner of his mind, as tiny as the smallest toy he\nhad ever seen in his childhood, he was still aware of the room and the\nship, and of Father Moontree picking up a telephone and speaking to a\nScanner captain in charge of the ship.\n\nHis telepathic mind caught the idea long before his ears could frame\nthe words. The actual sound followed the idea the way that thunder on\nan ocean beach follows the lightning inward from far out over the\nseas.\n\n\"The Fighting Room is ready. Clear to planoform, sir.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE PLAY\n\n\nUnderhill was always a little exasperated the way that Lady May\nexperienced things before he did.\n\nHe was braced for the quick vinegar thrill of planoforming, but he\ncaught her report of it before his own nerves could register what\nhappened.\n\nEarth had fallen so far away that he groped for several milliseconds\nbefore he found the Sun in the upper rear right-hand corner of his\ntelepathic mind.\n\nThat was a good jump, he thought. This way we'll get there in four or\nfive skips.\n\nA few hundred miles outside the ship, the Lady May thought back at\nhim, \"O warm, O generous, O gigantic man! O brave, O friendly, O\ntender and huge Partner! O wonderful with you, with you so good, good,\ngood, warm, warm, now to fight, now to go, good with you....\"\n\nHe knew that she was not thinking words, that his mind took the clear\namiable babble of her cat intellect and translated it into images\nwhich his own thinking could record and understand.\n\nNeither one of them was absorbed in the game of mutual greetings. He\nreached out far beyond her range of perception to see if there was\nanything near the ship. It was funny how it was possible to do two\nthings at once. He could scan space with his pin-set mind and yet at\nthe same time catch a vagrant thought of hers, a lovely, affectionate\nthought about a son who had had a golden face and a chest covered with\nsoft, incredibly downy white fur.\n\nWhile he was still searching, he caught the warning from her.\n\n_We jump again!_\n\nAnd so they had. The ship had moved to a second planoform. The stars\nwere different. The Sun was immeasurably far behind. Even the nearest\nstars were barely in contact. This was good Dragon country, this open,\nnasty, hollow kind of space. He reached farther, faster, sensing and\nlooking for danger, ready to fling the Lady May at danger wherever he\nfound it.\n\nTerror blazed up in his mind, so sharp, so clear, that it came through\nas a physical wrench.\n\nThe little girl named West had found something--something immense,\nlong, black, sharp, greedy, horrific. She flung Captain Wow at it.\n\nUnderhill tried to keep his own mind clear. \"Watch out!\" he shouted\ntelepathically at the others, trying to move the Lady May around.\n\nAt one corner of the battle, he felt the lustful rage of Captain Wow\nas the big Persian tomcat detonated lights while he approached the\nstreak of dust which threatened the ship and the people within.\n\nThe lights scored near-misses.\n\nThe dust flattened itself, changing from the shape of a sting-ray into\nthe shape of a spear.\n\nNot three milliseconds had elapsed.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFather Moontree was talking human words and was saying in a voice that\nmoved like cold molasses out of a heavy jar, \"C-A-P-T-A-I-N.\"\nUnderhill knew that the sentence was going to be \"Captain, move fast!\"\n\nThe battle would be fought and finished before Father Moontree got\nthrough talking.\n\nNow, fractions of a millisecond later, the Lady May was directly in\nline.\n\nHere was where the skill and speed of the Partners came in. She could\nreact faster than he. She could see the threat as an immense Rat\ncoming direct at her.\n\nShe could fire the light-bombs with a discrimination which he might\nmiss.\n\nHe was connected with her mind, but he could not follow it.\n\nHis consciousness absorbed the tearing wound inflicted by the alien\nenemy.
