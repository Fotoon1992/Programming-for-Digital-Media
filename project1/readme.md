The three words dictionary:
This project acts like a dictionary that could be used to translate three words from English to Arabic. It also gives accurate pronunciation. 
I was thinking of google translator when I built this project because I am always fascinated with all types of translators. This project is simple and basic, yet it was something I wanted to do for so long. 

Age calculator:
This project is what I wanted to do at the beginning before the dictionary one, but I couldn't figure out how to make it work with for____in____. I built it using variables instead, and It gives back the age in years when a person types her/his year of birth.
