Reflection 10/2


1- Chapter 7 was one of the best readings since it covers a lot of necessary steps and a variety of explanations. I have followed the passage by redoing and testing the examples that were defined. I compiled my testing codes under a file named ch.py inside the chapter7 file in my GitHub. I also did three of the exercises listed under Exercise7-2.py, Exercise7-3.py, and Exercise7-4.py in my GitHub as well.


Exercise7-2, I chose to convert between cm and inch because this is the thing I had trouble with the most since I came to the U.S.A, and now I have my converting program between those two measurements. Exercise7-3, I tried to do the odd and even numbers to work for this exercise. In the beginning, it was hard to make that work, but I get advantages of using Google!  Exercise7-4, add the raise ValueError to the fact(n) was easy, but adding it to the factorial(n) was not easy. I had some issues doing that since I was confused a little bit confused about range(), but I finally did it! 


2-Since we were experimenting with numbers and calculating, I would like to address an artist who programs his artwork in mathematical computation. Alan Rath is a sculptor who builds robotic, kinetic, and electric sculptures that could behave in a way to avoid repetition although lead to steadily unfolding performances. Their behaviors also programmed in an unusual move, and they will display new imagery after long periods. Changes could take years or even decades. 
I might refer to a new artist each time I do my weekly reflection. I am fascinated by artists who work in the same concept because it is my main focus for my graduation project!  


3- I had difficulties in doing Exercise7-5. I couldn’t figure out how to deal with that matter. I also had some challenges in doing multiplication of even numbers only, yet I looked it up on the internet and solved it.
