Reflection 10/2


1- Chapter 7 was one of the best readings since it covers a lot of necessary steps and a variety of explanations. I have followed the passage by redoing and testing the examples that were defined. I compiled my testing codes under a file named ch7.py in my GitHub. I also did three of the exercises listed under Exercise7-2.py, Exercise7-3.py, and Exercise7-4.py in my GitHub as well.  


2-Since we were experimenting with numbers and calculating, I would like to address an artist who programs his artwork in mathematical computation. Alan Rath is a sculptor who builds robotic, kinetic, and electric sculptures that could behave in a way to avoid repetition although lead to steadily unfolding performances. Their behaviors also programmed in an unusual move, and they will display new imagery after long periods. Changes could take years or even decades. 
I might refer to a new artist each time I do my weekly reflection. I am fascinated by artists who work in the same concept because it is my main focus for my graduation project!  


3- I had difficulties in doing Exercise7-5. I couldn’t figure out how to deal with that matter. I also had some challenges in doing multiplication of even numbers only, yet I looked it up on the internet and solved it.
